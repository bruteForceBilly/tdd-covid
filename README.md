Visitor registration vue app after test driven development method with jest.

### What is it?

This project primarily is an exploration of building an app with test driven development with vue and jest while shunning dependencies. As society opens up more and more from lockdown, I notice that many cafÃ©s and restaurants have started to use visitor registration apps, where visitors can can notify if they have any Covid-19 symptoms and give their contact information, see [example](https://bezoeker.app/). I thought it would be a pretty neat and fun project to build, as the project has good scope definition, yet some intricacies with form validation that could easily get hairy to code, and therefore helped by the red-green-blue process in tdd.

As the project progresses, it might become a blueprint for a free software product restaurateurs could self host.
